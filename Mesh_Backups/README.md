# PittMesh Backup Script
This script uses RSYNC to transfer files over the mesh. Often times these backup files can be large, and require a long time to fully transfer. This script ensure the file transfer continues even when the mesh connection gets interrupted. 

# How to use

This script is simple to use. First, set your info where the script asks for "root@100.*.*.*". Change this to the server you want to backup to. The rest is self explanatory and the script will guide you through filling in the rest of the data.
